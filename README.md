# Primegaps-v2
Models, data, and visualizations for our studies of Eratosthenes sieve as a discrete dynamic system.  This repository will replace the original one.

These are some of the materials supporting my exploration of the cycles of gaps across stages of Eratosthenes sieve. For the Python notebooks, see the Table of Contents file. I uploaded the data files that I could, but a couple of the larger ones will have to be regenerated from the Python code, e.g. the files containing the cycles G23 and G29.

<b>Note on v2:</b> I have reorganized the material for this repository.  The code base will be more complete, and some of the code will be more flexible than in the original Primegaps repository.

Over the years I have used R for the calculations and then Excel and Powerpoint for creating figures and tables.
Initially I shared an Excel workbook here and was encouraged to post Python notebooks to make the work more accessible. I hope these notebooks help in that regard.

NOTES on Dependencies:
The notebooks are numbered, and any dependencies should be resolved by executing the earlier notebooks.
The greatest dependencies are in accessing the large data files.  For example, the cycle G(29#) and its Delta-Phi representation both have to created.
